# Home Network Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates a **home network simulation** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The design includes a mix of **wired and wireless devices** connected to a home wireless router.

## Project Contents
- **PacketTracer_Files/** → `.pkt` file of the home network.
- **Documentation/** → Design explanation, device configurations, and screenshots.

## Tools Used

- Networking protocols: DHCP, ICMP, wireless security (WPA2)

## Features
- Wireless router with DHCP enabled for automatic IP assignment
- Multiple end devices:
  - Gaming PC (wired connection)
  - Laptop (wireless connection)
  - Smartphone (wireless connection)
  - Tablet (wireless connection)
  - Printer (wired connection)
- Secure wireless SSID with WPA2
- End-to-end connectivity tested with `ping`

## Skills Demonstrated
